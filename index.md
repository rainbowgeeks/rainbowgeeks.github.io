# Overview
VolunteerAlly is a non-profit organization designed to help pair volunteers with organizations in need of service. Thus, the rainbowgeeks team has designed a web application that aims to ease the user's experience when it comes to finding, applying, and volunteering for an organization.

# Approach
When a volunteer signs up for an account and creates their profile, they can add information about their interests, environmental preferences, and availability to better pair them with an organization or opportunity. 

Representatives of organizations can also sign up for an account and post their opportunities as a way to find and recruit volunteers.

Meanwhile, administrators monitor the site for inappropriate content or assist new users in the onboarding process.

Some mockup pages include:
